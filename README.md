## Problem Statement:
I've been asked to analyze the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) survey results for the last 9 years.
MY task is to evaluate whether the HCAHPS survey has been successful in accomplishing this goal by answering questions like these:
+ Have hospitals' HCAHPS scores improved over the past 9 years?
+ Are there any specific areas where hospitals have made more progress than others?
+ Are there any major areas of opportunity remaining?
+ What recommendations can you make to hospitals to help them further improve the patient experience?

## Data Source: 

## Data Praperation:
+ Use Power Query Editor within Power BI to clean and preprocess the collected data. This involves handling missing values, Replacing values, and ensuring data consistency.
+ Develop an effective data model that allows for the exploration of trends, patterns, and correlations within the HCAHPS survey data. This involves creating relationships between different data tables and establishing calculated measures for deeper insights.

## Insights:
+ Hospitals, on average, maintained relatively stable scores from 2015 to 2021. A concerning trend emerged in the last two years (2021-2023) as hospital scores started to decline. Identifying the root causes of this decline and implementing corrective measures promptly should be a priority to maintain and improve patient satisfaction.
+ Several key aspects of hospital care, including discharge information, communication with doctors and nurses, cleanliness of the hospital and the hospital environment and willingness to recommend hospital have been consistently rated positively by patients. Understanding the practices that lead to high scores in these areas can guide improvements in other aspects of care like responsiveness of hospital staff, communication about medicines, quietness of hospital environment and car transition as they are scored low.
+ Over the nine-year period, there has been a noticeable decline in patient responses to the HCAHPS survey. This trend suggests a potential need for strategies to encourage more active participation or a reevaluation of the survey's effectiveness.
+ Hospitals located in states such as South Dakota, Nebraska, Louisiana, kansas and minnesota received high scores in the HCAHPS survey. This suggests that there may be regional differences in healthcare quality and patient satisfaction that warrant further exploration.
